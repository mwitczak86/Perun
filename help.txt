# Meet Perun, the thunder god
For many pagan slavs, **Perun** was the most important god. He was powerful, fierce but also kind and live-giving. 
Just like the ***Information Gathering*** is the first step for every penetration test. 
Without information about your target, you will go nowhere.
If you will get enough data, you can decide how to use it.
**Perun** is a python tool designed to gather information about domains and subdomains using passive recon. 
It was developed and tested for *ParrotOs*.

**Perun** enumerates subdomains using popular python libraries and online tools.
It does nothing new, being a simple commands wrapper, it will help you receive the basic pieces of information in just a few clicks.

## Dependencies:
As mentioned above **Perun** depends on several different libraries.
1. rich (library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal)
2. tld (Extract the top-level domain (TLD) from the URL given)
3. requests
4. json
5. dig
6. VirusTotal (free virus, malware, and URL online scanning service):
